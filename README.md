## Sharic
**Sharik for command line**
This repo is very very old, and untested, so please don't use it. I hope to rewrite backend of the app from Dart to Rust soon. That's when we'll have a proper cli version :)

### Install
You can install it via golang packet manager:

`go get -u github.com/marchellodev/sharic`

If you don't have golang installed on your system, download the latest build for your system from [Github Actions](https://github.com/marchellodev/sharic/actions)
